# Midwest Emo Scratch Page 🎸😭

This is a scratch page and portfolio site created for my Web Development class at BYU. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate competency in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap by building a professional-looking website alongside a completely custom-coded scratch page — and to have a little fun crying in lowercase.

## 🤖 Song Title Generator

The web app is a Mad Libs-style **Midwest Emo Song Title Generator**, made with vanilla JavaScript. It takes user input (like favorite snack, type of car, someone’s name) and turns it into tragic bangers like:

- *"You Threw My Slim Jim Out the Window of the Prius"*
- *"Sorry I Ate Your Fruit Snacks, Maddie"*
- *"I Can't Drive Past the Shell Station Without Crying"*

This app is:
- Fully responsive
- All HTML, CSS, and JS in one file
- Linked from the main scratch page
